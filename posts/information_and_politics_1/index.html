<p>As political economy is a topic I find particularly interesting, I’ll present the step-by-step “derivations” for a simplified version (one region and one public good) of first lemma in Boffa, Federico, Amedeo Piolatto, and Giacomo AM Ponzetto. “<a href="http://crei.cat/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ponzetto_centralization_accountability_072015-1.pdf">Political centralization and government accountability.</a>” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 131.1 (2016): 381-422. Disclaimer: some of this derivations come from a beamer presentation on the paper, given by Ponzetto.</p>
<p>In this model, the question we want to answer is: How does a more informed public affect political rent extraction? Does better public information lead to better policies?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bahagwati (1988)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am somewhat optimistic that the mere act of recognizing [bad policies] will help trigger a corrective response. In these matters, we can count on assistance from what I call the Dracula Effect: exposing evil to sunlight helps destroy it.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In this model, voters will engage in retrospective voting. Since candidates can not credibly commit to policy choices once they get a hold of office, voters evaluate politicians on the basis of their track record. We will assume that the politicians incentive is to extract rents, at least in the short run, but he also has a long-run desire to get re-elected and keep on extracting rents. Voters will infer the incumbents quality from his performance in office and in the elections will select politicians that seem better than the average, since challengers are drawn randomly from the same pool of politicians. Ruling politicians try to impress voters by showing that they have high ability, competence, productivity or signalling that their preferences are aligned wit the citizen’s interests. The model we will present will focus on the ability of politicians, those interested in preferences they can read <a href="http://epge.fgv.br/we/MD/EconomiaPolitica/2007?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Besley+completebook.pdf">Besley (2006)</a>.</p>
<p>First, we have the following allocation of resources for an exogenous, invariant and balanced government budget:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r_t + x_t = b 
\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>r</em> is the amount of rents extracted by the politician, <em>x</em> the amount of resources put into the production of the public good and <em>b</em> the budget resources.</p>
<p>Politicians are assumed to be entirely selfish. Their behaviour is only driven by their desire to extract present and future rents. Politicians want to maximize the present value of rents, with a discount factor <span class="math inline">\(\delta \in (0,1)\)</span>. Public goods <em>g</em> are provided by the following constant returns to scale production function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
g_t = e^{\eta_t} x_t 
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> is the politicians ability, which follows an MA(1) process:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\eta_t = \varepsilon_t + \varepsilon_{t-1} 
\]</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2) 
\]</span></p>
<p>that is <em>iid</em> across politicians and periods. <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> should be interpreted as parties being composed of overlapping generations of politicians. The period <em>t</em> government consists of older party leaders with competence <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{t-1}\)</span> and young, new party members with competence <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{t}\)</span>. At <em>t+1</em> the older party members retire, young members take over and a new cohort joins the party. The welfare of the <em>i</em> th citizen (assumed to be infinitely lived) is given by a log utility function with public goods provision as it’s only argument</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
u_t^i = ln(g_t)
\]</span></p>
<p>One could add a sum outside the logarithm for other utility derived from other sources and it doesn’t change anything if it does not interact with stuff in the model, this addition is assumed as given.</p>
<p>Now let’s specify the timing of the model:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The incumbents past <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{t-1}\)</span> becomes public knowledge.</li>
<li>The incumbent chooses <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span> (doesn’t know <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span>)
<ul>
<li>The incumbent has no private information to signalling<br />
</li>
<li>Signalling models are natural for preference heterogeneity which we assume not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> is realized and <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span> is determined</li>
<li>Each voter <em>i</em> observes <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(\theta_i\)</span>
<ul>
<li>Independent arrival of information across voters</li>
<li>No direct information on <span class="math inline">\(r_t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span>. Voters can only directly access information on <span class="math inline">\(\{r_i\}_{i=0}^{t-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{\varepsilon_i\}_{i=0}^{t-1}\)</span> [note that the voter can get <span class="math inline">\(\{g_i\}_{i=0}^{t-1}\)</span> from the previous information]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An election is held pitting the incumbent against a random challenger.</li>
</ol>
<p>For point 4, what will be done is that there are two types of voters, informed and uninformed. Informed voters will have observed <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span> and uninformed voters will have not.<br />
Now, the incumbent <em>I</em> and challenger <em>C</em> are drawn from the same pool. Voters expect a given level of effort <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> from any politician in every period. The public goods production function performance is separable in effort <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> and talent <span class="math inline">\(\eta_t\)</span>. Since there is no information available about <em>C</em>, since it has not governed yet, voters expect from <em>C</em> a random ability <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{t+1}^C\)</span>. Thus, if the challenger wins, every voter expects the following public good provision:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}\left(ln(g_{t+1}^C)\right) &amp;= \mathbb{E}\left(ln \left(e^{\eta_{t+1}^C} x_{t+1}\right)\right) \\
    &amp;= \mathbb{E}\left( \eta_{t+1}^C ln\left(e\right) + ln\left(x_{t+1}\right) \right) \\
    &amp;= \mathbb{E}\left( \eta_{t+1}^C\right) + \mathbb{E}\left(ln(x_{t+1}) \right) \\
    &amp;= \mathbb{E}\left(\varepsilon_{t+1}\right) + \mathbb{E}\left(\varepsilon_{t}\right) + ln(\bar{x}) \\
    &amp;= ln(\bar{x})
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since the challenger has not governed, the expected value of <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{t+1}\)</span> conditional of the information available today is 0. Uninformed voters, since they don’t know <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span>, have no way of inferring the incumbents skill. Today’s <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is not in today’s information set, they know <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{t-1}\)</span>, but have no idea of <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> at <em>t</em> and thus of <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{t+1}\)</span> at <em>t</em>. Remember that citizens are voting today, to elect that will be the governing politician tomorrow, in <em>t+1</em>. When voters have no information of the incumbent, it’s just like the challenger, they don’t expect different public goods from <em>I</em> than from <em>C</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Delta_0 = \mathbb{E}\left(ln(g_{t+1}^I)\right) - \mathbb{E}\left(ln(g_{t+1}^C)\right) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>The expected utility in terms of public goods of the incumbent winning, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_0\)</span> is 0 for uninformed voters. Now, remember that some voters, with probability <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> knew <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span>? This are informed voters. Informed voters can infer <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span> given <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}( \eta_{t+1}^I | g_t) = \underbrace{\mathbb{E}( \varepsilon_{t+1} | g_t)}_0 + \mathbb{E}( \varepsilon_{t} | g_t) = ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, an informed voter’s utility expectation of the current incumbent providing public goods tomorrow is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
    \mathbb{E}\left( ln\left( g_{t+1}^I \right) | g_t \right) &amp;= \mathbb{E}\left(ln \left(e^{\eta_{t+1}^I} x_{t+1}\right)| g_t \right) \\
    &amp;= \mathbb{E}\left( \eta_{t+1}^I ln\left(e\right) + ln\left(x_{t+1}\right) | g_t \right) \\
    &amp;= \mathbb{E}\left( \eta_{t+1}^I | g_t \right) + \mathbb{E}\left(ln(x_{t+1}) \right) \\
    &amp;= ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} + ln(\bar{x})\\
    &amp;= ln(g_t) - \varepsilon_{t-1}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The expected utility in terms of public goods of the incumbent winning, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_1\)</span>, for uninformed voters is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation*}
            \Delta_1 = \mathbb{E}(ln(g_{t+1}^I) | g_t) - \mathbb{E}(ln(g_{t+1}^C)) = ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1}
\end{equation*}
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_1 &gt; 0\)</span>, the informed voters expect the incumbent to be more generous in the public good provision. Informed and uninformed voters expect different pay-offs from the incumbent winning. Now we will add non-policy preferences. Say each candidates has some exogenous characteristics, whether it is individual personality and background or history and long-standing ideology of the party. Something that voters like, some kind of charisma, but that does not affect policy choices (the amount of public good provision).</p>
<p>Say voter <em>i</em> now has an idiosyncratic taste <span class="math inline">\(\xi_i^P\)</span> for politician P’s characteristics. If a politician P is elected, the <em>i</em>th voters satisfaction is now:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
ln\left(g_{t+1}^P\right) + \xi_i^P
\]</span></p>
<p>We have a continuum of atomistic agents (implication: no single vote can be pivotal and there is no motivation for strategic voting, citizens always vote truthfully with regard to their preferences, represented by the above utility function), say distributed along a line of length 1, so there is a mass of 1 citizens. This continuum of atomistic agents are partitioned into J internally homogeneous groups. Group <em>j</em> has a size share <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_j\)</span> and a share <span class="math inline">\(\theta_j\)</span> of its voters are informed. (Note that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j = 1\)</span>) This idiosyncratic tasted can be decomposed in an aggregate popularity shock and an individual, idiosyncratic, shock. This shocks introduce randomness at the level of the individual vote and the overall election, so that neither is predictable with absolute certainty.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    \underbrace{\xi_i^C - \xi_i^I}_{\text{idiosyncratic taste utility gain when the challenger wins}} = \underbrace{\Psi_t}_{\text{aggregate popularity shock}} + \underbrace{\psi_t^i}_{\text{idyosincratic shock}}
\]</span></p>
<p>This shocks follow the following distributions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Psi_t \sim U [-1/(2\Phi), 1/(2\Phi)]
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\psi_t^i \sim U [-1/(2\phi), 1/(2\phi)]
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i(g_t) \geq \Psi_t + \psi_t^i \Longrightarrow\)</span> the <em>i</em>th voter, votes for the incumbent, otherwise votes for the challenger. For each type of voter, uninformed and informed, this condition would take the following form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    \Delta_i(g_t) =  
        \begin{cases} 
            \Delta_0 = \mathbb{E}ln(g_{t+1}^I) - \mathbb{E}ln(g_{t+1}^C) \geq \Psi_t + \psi_t^0 = \xi_0^C - \xi_0^I  \\
            \Delta_1 = \mathbb{E}ln(g_{t+1}^I | g_t) - \mathbb{E}ln(g_{t+1}^C | g_t) \geq \Psi_t + \psi_t^1 = \xi_1^C - \xi_1^I
        \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>From now on, I’ll omit the conditionals from the notation, assuming we already take that into account in their information set, without loss of generality. So:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathbb{E}_i ln(g_{t+1}^I) - \mathbb{E}_i ln(g_{t+1}^C) \geq \xi_i^C - \xi_i^I
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_i ln(g_{t+1}^I) + \xi_i^I}_{\text{utility of the ith voter if the incumbent wins}} \geq \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_i ln(g_{t+1}^C) + \xi_i^C}_{\text{utility of the ith voter if the challenger wins}}  
\]</span></p>
<p>All of this has been derived from <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_i(g_t) \geq \Psi_t + \psi_t^i\)</span>, so it’s now easier to see why this condition implies and stands for. Now say that the public goods provision and the aggregate popularity shock, <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_t\)</span>, are realized. The share of members from group <em>j</em> that will vote for the incumbent is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
    v_t^j(g_t, \Psi_t) &amp;= \theta_j*Pr(\underbrace{\psi_t^i \leq \Delta_1 - \Psi_t}_{\text{condition for the informed citizen to vote the incumbent}}) + (1-\theta_j)*Pr(\underbrace{\psi_t^i \leq \Delta_0 - \Psi_t}_{\text{condition for the uninformed citizen to vote the incumbent}}) \\
    &amp;= \theta_j*Pr(\psi_t^i \leq ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} - \Psi_t) + (1-\theta_j)*Pr(\psi_t^i \leq - \Psi_t) \\
    &amp;= \theta_j F_{\psi_t^i} \left( ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} - \Psi_t \right) + (1-\theta_j) F_{\psi_t^i} \left( - \Psi_t \right)  \\
    &amp;= \theta_j \left( \frac{ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} - \Psi_t - \left( -\frac{1}{2\phi}\right)}{\frac{1}{2\phi} - \left(-\frac{1}{2\phi}\right)} \right) + (1-\theta_j)\left( \frac{- \Psi_t - \left( -\frac{1}{2\phi}\right)}{\frac{1}{2\phi} - \left(-\frac{1}{2\phi}\right)} \right) \\
    &amp; \text{some more simplifying steps...} \\
    &amp;= \theta_j \left( \phi \left( ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} - \Psi_t \right) + \frac{1}{2} \right) + (1-\theta_j) \left( \frac{1}{2} - \phi \Psi_t \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \phi \left( \theta_j [ ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} ] - \Psi_t \right)
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Ufff, finally we derived the probability of an homogeneous group <em>j</em> voting the incumbent assuming that public good provision today has been realized and the idiosyncratic shock too (not really, but since the shocks are i.i.d it doesn’t matter for our probability calculations). Note that if: <span class="math inline">\(\left( ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} \right) \theta_j - \Psi_t\)</span> is positive, the <em>j</em>th group winner is the incumbent. Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\psi_t^i\)</span> is realized is reasonable since groups are internally homogeneous and <span class="math inline">\(\psi_t^i\)</span> is independent Of preferences across voters.</p>
<p>Let’s go on to calculate the probability of re-election. The public good is realized, but <span class="math display">\[\Psi_t\]</span>, the aggregate idiosyncratic shock, is not yet realized.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
        \underbrace{\pi(g_t)}_{\text{probability of the incumbent being re-elected}} &amp;= Pr \left( \sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j v_t^j(g_t, \Psi_t) \geq \frac{1}{2} \right)\\
        &amp;= Pr \left( \sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j \left \{ \frac{1}{2} + \phi[ \theta_j(ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \epsilon_{t-1}) - \Psi_t ] \right \} \geq \frac{1}{2} \right)\\
        &amp;= Pr \left( \Psi_t \leq (ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \epsilon_{t-1}) \sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j \theta_j \right) \\
        &amp;= Pr \left( \Psi_t \leq (ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \epsilon_{t-1}) \bar{\theta} \right); \hspace{0.2cm} \bar{\theta} = \sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j \theta_j \\
        &amp;= F_{\Psi_t}((ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1})\bar{\theta})\\
        &amp;= \frac{(ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1})\bar{\theta})- \left( - \frac{1}{2\Phi} \right)}{\frac{1}{2\Phi} - \left( - \frac{1}{2\Phi} \right)}\\
        &amp;= \Phi \bar{\theta} ( ln(g_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \varepsilon_{t-1} ) + \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The next step is to find the probability of re-election from the perspective of the incumbent. Remember that the incumbent doesn’t get to choose <span class="math inline">\(g_t\)</span>, that has the stochastic factor <span class="math inline">\(e^{\eta_t}\)</span>, but it does get to choose the amount of resources from the budget that are allocated to the public good provision <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span>. The incumbent chooses <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> and is subject to the risk of getting low ability party members <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_t\)</span>. Since he knows the amount of <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span>, he has a better insight into the outcome of the election:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align}
        \pi(x_t) &amp;= \mathbb{E}[\pi(g_t) |x_t] = \frac{1}{2} + \bar{\theta} \Phi [\mathbb{E}(ln(g_t)|x_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \epsilon_{t-1}]\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \bar{\theta}\Phi[\mathbb{E}(\epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_t + ln(x_t|x_t) - ln(\bar{x}) - \epsilon_{t-1}]\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \bar{\theta} \Phi (ln(x_t) - ln(\bar{x}))
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now we are getting to the interesting stuff. From this last equation we see that the incumbent seems more capable than he actually is if he spends more than what the voters are anticipating <span class="math inline">\((x_t &gt; \bar{x})\)</span>. The more the incumbent spends on public good provision, the higher the chances of re-election. We can now move on to what we will call the ‘’Career Concerns’’ problem of the politcian.</p>
<p>Say the incumbent values being re-elected? Why? Because if re-elected he can get rents for another whole period. At the same time, the incumbent likes extracting rents today <span class="math inline">\((r_t = b - x_t)\)</span> but that might give him away. Suppose that the value of re-election is <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. This problem is of a recursive nature, in the next period the politician will face the same issue. Note, and this is very important, that the <span class="math inline">\(bar{x}\)</span> is not a choice variable in the politician’s maximization problem, the politician can not choose voter’s expectations. The problem can be set as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\max_{x_t} \left \{ b - x_t + R\pi(x_t) \right) \}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\max_{x_t} \left \{\underbrace{ b - x_t + R \left[\frac{1}{2} + \bar{\theta} \Phi (ln(x_t) - ln(\bar{x})\right]}_{L} \right \}
\]</span></p>
<p>subject to the budget constraint. We solve the maximization problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_t} = -1 + R\Phi \bar{\theta} \frac{1}{x_t} = 0 \Longrightarrow x_t^* = R \Phi \bar{\theta}
\]</span></p>
<p>$$  = -R{}x_t^{-2} &lt; 0</p>
<p>$$</p>
<p>Thus: <span class="math inline">\(r_t^* = b- R\Phi\bar{\theta}\)</span></p>
<p>We will now impose rational expectations in order to pin down an equilibrium. Voters just solve the same exact problem that we just did to asses the expected level of public expenditure <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>! So: <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x} = \bar{\theta}R\Phi\)</span></p>
<p>The, since <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x} = x^*\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\pi(\bar{x}) = \frac{1}{2} + \bar{\theta}\Phi (ln(\bar{x}) - ln(\bar{x})) = \frac{1}{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>In equilibrium the probability of re-election of the incumbent is one half, and so the probability of the challenger being elected is also one half. Without private information, one can’t, systematically, fool the voters. A stationary equilibrium with rational expectations implies this, that <span class="math inline">\(x^* = \bar{x}\)</span>. Even without voters knowing <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span>, if politicians raise <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> to inflate their perceived ability, voters will raise their expectations <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> eventually since they can’t be systematically fooled. The cost of raising <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> above <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is too high for the politician. The next thing we must ask ourselves is. What is R? The value of future rents:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
R = \delta \sum_{t=0}^\infty \left( \frac{\delta}{2} \right)^t r^* = \frac{2\delta}{2 - \delta} r^*
\]</span></p>
<p>With this previous equation and the equation found by solving the Career Concerns problem, we can obtain the unique level of rent extraction in the stationary equilibrium:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
r = b \left( 1+ \frac{2\delta}{2-\delta}\bar{\theta}\Phi \right)^{-1}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\rho(\theta) = \frac{r}{b} = \left(1 + \theta\frac{2\delta}{2-\delta}\Phi \right)^{-1}
\]</span></p>
<p>I’ll leave the derivation of the politician’s ability in the stationary equilibrium for another post. Let’s first comment the results we found so far.</p>
<p>We first see that politicians in office don’t steal everything, this is because they limit their rent extraction due to career concerns. Here, a permanent increase in voter information has two effects on election discipline. On one hand, it makes re-election more responsive to performance, raising incentives to reduce rents. On the other hand, this very reduction in equilibrium rents, lowers the appeal of re-election and thus indirectly dampens the decline in rent extraction. In the model the direct effect always dominates, but rent extraction falls with voter information at a declining rate because of the countervailing indirect effects. Better information improves government accountability because it enables voters to monitor politicians more closely. Evidence points to the fact that there is a positive relationship between higher information/education of citizens and political accountability, although the concavity relationship or the <span class="math inline">\(\rho(\theta)\)</span> function (share of rent extraction) is not explored. One piece of such evidence is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160323200043/http://economics.mit.edu/files/2984">Snyder and Strömberg (2010)</a>, just reading the introduction is enough.</p>
