<p>I’ve found out a <a href="http://www.rationalreflection.net/common-objections-to-pascals-wager/">page/post which responds pretty well to some standard objections to Pascal’s Wager</a>, but I still think that an appropriate response might lie in objection 18, placing a finite upper bound on utility functions.</p>
<center>
<img src="/images/posts/pascalwager.jpg"/>
</center>
<p>As it’s standard practice in macroeconomics, the use of an infinitely lived representative agent can allow us to shed some light on this issue. Another standard practice in economics is to assume that utility is <em>time separable</em>, so we have a certain utility function for which we can know utility at each period in <em>t</em> and they are not directly dependent of each other (if you consume less one period you might be able to consume more another period, that is why I don’t say completely independent). Another standard assumption is decreasing marginal utility, that could be represented by a strictly concave functions such as <span class="math inline">\(u(c_t ) = log(c_t)\)</span>. One problem with this is that decreasing marginal utility does not guarantee an upper bound for utility each period, as $_{c_t } log(c_t) = $ (this same issue arises in the St Petersburg Paradox, that is why marginal utility does not solve the paradox). Does this mean we have to give in to Pascal’s wager? Not so, there might be other reasonable arguments to assume some kind of “upper bound”.</p>
<p>The first argument would be that the utility function should have some kind of bliss point <span class="math inline">\(c^*\)</span>, making the utility function take forms such as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
u(c_t) = -\frac{1}{2} (c_t - c^*)^2 + 1000 ; \ \ where \ 0 &lt; c^* &lt; \infty
\]</span></p>
<p>Why there might be a bliss point? Because people get saturated from consumption. Having some good meals, drinks and sex might be great, but you don’t want to have 77 good meals, drinks or sex, at least in the same day, even if they were for free, if t hey did not detract from future meals, drinks or sex (for the alcoholic beverages case it’s easy to see why…) and so on.</p>
<p>Another argument would be to specify the utility function as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
u(c_t ) =
\left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        log(c_t)  &amp; \mbox{if } c_t \leq c^* \\
        log(c^*) &amp; \mbox{if } c_t &gt; c^*
    \end{array}
\right.
\]</span></p>
<p>In this case, the utility function has a finite upper bound. This might be because within a period (say a day, a month, year and so on) we can only consume a finite amount of drinks, food, drive a finite number of cars, visit a certain number of locations and so on. This restriction within each period would place an upper bound on the total amount of consumption (or whatever thing we derive pleasure form) in each period such that $ c_t c^* ; 0 c^* &lt; $, and thus it places a finite upper bound to utility in each period.</p>
<p>Still, if we have finite utility at each period, even for infinite consumption in each periods, if we aggregate through an infinite lifetime, couldn’t we get that the total infinite lifetime utility is infinite and Pascal’s Wager would follow through? Not quite.</p>
<p>To aggregate the total utility of an infinite lifetime, a common assumption is exponential discounting (the same results follow with other types of discounting, such as hyperbolic discounting). It’s similar to discounting future payments through an interest rate, but we say that the individual has some kind of “internal” interest rate which defines how patient or impatient she is. Therefore, the discount factor is <span class="math inline">\(\beta = \frac{1}{1+\rho}\)</span>, so if <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> takes positive finite values, <span class="math inline">\(\beta \in (0,1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>When we add utility across periods, this implies that, at infinity, the present discounted value of some finite utility is 0, that is why the total infinite lifetime utility at time <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> (time of death) from getting to heaven:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{eqnarray*}
 \Lambda &amp;=&amp; \sum_{j=0}^\infty \beta^{j} u(c_{T+j}); \ where \ c_t = c^* \ \forall t \geq T \\
    &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1-\beta} u(c^*) &lt; \infty
\end{eqnarray*}
\]</span></p>
<p>is finite. A powerful reason for discounting is that if we had a risk neutral agent: <span class="math inline">\(u(c_t) = c_t\)</span>; if discounting was not present (<span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span>) the agent could always postpone consumption without any utility penalization and so she would get thinner and thinner and eventually consume everything just before dying from starvation :P … thus one interesting result for this is that a risk neutral non discounting agent would want to commit suicide if that would get him sooner to heaven (as any other agent would if the sum of discounted utilities in heaven was infinite).</p>
<p>Now, if for some reason we believe that this is some kind of payoff that will only happen in an extremely unlikely state of nature: <span class="math inline">\(Pr(jackpot) \approx 0%\)</span>; while the alternative is 0 utility. The expected value of belief at the time of death <span class="math inline">\((T)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\approx \Lambda * 0 = 0\)</span> ; thus for small costs of believing, Pascal’s wager might not go through.</p>
<p>In the end, there are good reasons, not ad-hoc, to assume with pretty much certainty that the utility function has a finite upper bound. Also, “Counterintuitive results at the point where a unit of happiness has no extra value for us” is not exactly true, it would be that for some additional units of consumption we don’t get some extra utility/happiness, which does not sound counterintuitive.</p>
