      <description>body {text-align: justify}The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been using Growth-at-Risk, a macro-econometric tool developed by them to assess risks to economic growth, in several article IV country reports (Albania, Portugal and Singapore 2018), Chapter 2 of the IMF Global Financial Conditions Report since October 2017 and so on. The tool is built taking the methodology developed in the AER April 2019 paper Vulnerable Growth. I have several disagreements about the statistical procedures used and the interpretation of the results in the AER paper, which you can read here in my working papers.</description>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Python implementation of the Direct Expected Shortfall Test of Acerbi and Szekely (2014).I don’t know of any implementation of such test in Python. The test has been implemented in MatLab. The backtesting of Expected Shortfall has long been a difficult task due to the lack of elicitibility. The test I’ve implemented is the second test of Acerbi and Szekely and it’s full details are in the reference.</description>

      <title>Puzzles and the Behavioural New Keynesian Model</title>
      <link>https://llucpuigcodina.github.io/posts/determinacy_gabaix_new_keynesian_model/</link>

      <description>Herein I conduct similar policy experiments to those of Carlstrom et al. (2012) with a Behavioural New Keynesian (BNK) model, instead of the standard New Keynesian model (only) or a sticky information model. The BNK model does a good job of solving previous issues with the standard model (as already noted by Gabaix).
All of this work is already, explicitly or implicitly, in the cited articles, so I wouldn’t claim to show anything new.</description>

      <title>Determinacy in a New Keynesian Model under a Money Growth Rule</title>
      <link>https://llucpuigcodina.github.io/posts/determinacy_new_keynesian_model/</link>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}This note derives the analytical conditions for determinacy in a canonical New Keynesian model under an exogenous path for the growth rate of the money supply. Under cash-when-I’m-done timing the model is always determinate while indeterminacy can arise with cash-in-advance timing.
