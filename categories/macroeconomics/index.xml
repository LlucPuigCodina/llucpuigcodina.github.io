      <description>body {text-align: justify}The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been using Growth-at-Risk, a macro-econometric tool developed by them to assess risks to economic growth, in several article IV country reports (Albania, Portugal and Singapore 2018), Chapter 2 of the IMF Global Financial Conditions Report since October 2017 and so on. The tool build from the AER April 2019 Vulnerable Growth paper. I have several disagreements about the statistical procedures used and the interpretation of the results from the AER paper, which you can read here in my working papers.</description>

      <title>Puzzles and the Behavioural New Keynesian Model</title>

      <description>Herein I conduct similar policy experiments to those of Carlstrom et al. (2012) with a Behavioural New Keynesian (BNK) model, instead of the standard New Keynesian model (only) or a sticky information model. The BNK model does a good job of solving previous issues with the standard model (as already noted by Gabaix).
All of this work is already, explicitly or implicitly, in the cited articles, so I wouldn’t claim to show anything new.</description>

      <title>Determinacy in a New Keynesian Model under a Money Growth Rule</title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}This note derives the analytical conditions for determinacy in a canonical New Keynesian model under an exogenous path for the growth rate of the money supply. Under cash-when-I’m-done timing the model is always determinate while indeterminacy can arise with cash-in-advance timing.
