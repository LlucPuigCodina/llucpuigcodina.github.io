      <title>On the limiting behaviour of the Uhlig 1997 Stochastic Volatility model</title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Uhlig (1997) proposed a VAR with stochastic volatility where precision, the inverse of variance, is given by a multiplicative process with beta innovations. The model lends itself to a high level of tractability since exact updating formulas are obtained. Lately I’ve been playing around with this model and found out some interesting aspects.
For the simple scalar case the model is as follows:</description>

      <title>Drawing with Restrictions in MCMC</title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}It is often the case that, when simulating from posterior distributions using MCMC, researchers wish to impose restrictions on some parameters.
Two illustrative cases are discussed in Geweke’s Contemporary Bayesian Econometrics and Statistics Example 4.2.2 and 4.3.2 . The following description of the setup (and notation) is taken almost verbatim from Geweke. These examples consider a normal linear regression model with Gaussian disturbances in which the prior of \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) (the regression coefficient) given \(h\) (precision) is \(\mathscr{N}(\underline{\boldsymbol{\beta}}, \underline{\textbf{H}})\) truncated to a set \(S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^k\).</description>

      <title>Growth-at-Risk IMF Tool</title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been using Growth-at-Risk, a macro-econometric tool developed by them to assess risks to economic growth, in several article IV country reports (Albania, Portugal and Singapore 2018), Chapter 2 of the IMF Global Financial Conditions Report since October 2017 and so on. The tool is built taking the methodology developed in the AER April 2019 paper Vulnerable Growth. I have several disagreements about the statistical procedures used and the interpretation of the results in the AER paper, which you can read here in my working papers.</description>

      <title>Tests for correct specification of conditional predictive densities</title>
      <link>https://llucpuigcodina.github.io/posts/rossi_cond_density_tests/</link>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}I have implemented the statistical tests of Rossi and Sekhposyan (2019) in R. You can find the codes in the following Github repo. Two tests, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and an Cràmer-von Mises test, are implemented to assess the correct specification of rolling window conditional distribution out-of-sample forecasts, one and multiple steps ahead.
Thew hole idea of the test is the following: let \(X\) be a random variable with cdf \(F_X\) (with well defined \(F_X^{-1}\)).</description>

      <title>Acerbi &amp; Szekely Unconditional Expected Shortfall Test</title>

      <description>body {text-align: justify}Python implementation of the Direct Expected Shortfall Test of Acerbi and Szekely (2014).I don’t know of any implementation of such test in Python. The test has been implemented in MatLab. The backtesting of Expected Shortfall has long been a difficult task due to the lack of elicitibility. The test I’ve implemented is the second test of Acerbi and Szekely and it’s full details are in the reference.</description>
